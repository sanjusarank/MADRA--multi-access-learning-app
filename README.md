# MADRA

Overview:

This paper describes a multi-access learning app”MADRA” that helps in
improving skills, providing assistance in career guidance, allowing staff to
upload teaching videos, and providing predictions that aid in their career
growth.
Purpose:
● The main goal is to provide students with personalized education
plans and to assist them in narrowing their search for career
advancement.
● It also allows staff and graduated veterans to share their thoughts
on the subject based on their experiences.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
Obtain the user's information and provide the appropriate course. The
"MADRA"exclusive chatbot assists in providing the user with the
appropriate videos. This chatbot allows the user to change the language
used in the video to one that is more comfortable for them. It is an
AI-powered study tool that allows for information sharing and acquisition.
It removes barriers such as a lack of a source, language barriers, and so
on.It improves the AI's ability to provide efficient learning.
Our project aims to create a new interactive AI-learning platform where
students and teachers can freely access and upload videos of their
content, as well as insights and day-to-day learning activity

UNIQUENESS:
● Our app teaches students using both live classes from providers and
AI models such as generative pre-trained transformer model.
● To provide students with personalized recommendations for
courses, learning materials, or career paths, you can consider
implementing a recommender system. A recommender system uses
machine learning to analyze a user's behavior and preferences and
provide them with recommendations that are tailored to their
individual needs.
● It also has a text-to-voice feature, and this AI bot can translate the
voice automatic speech recognition model to the customer's
preferred language.
● It can also assist students with career guidance and freshmen in
deciding which industry to pursue, as well as provide more current
events in the industry.
● Natural Language Generation: To provide students with a more
engaging and interactive learning experience, you can consider
implementing natural language generation. Natural language
generation allows AI models to generate human-like text that can be
used to provide explanations, examples, and feedback to students.
● Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) uses machine learning
algorithms to dynamically adjust the difficulty level of exam
questions based on a student's performance. This can help ensure
that each student is tested at an appropriate level of difficulty and
can help reduce testing time.

SOFTWARE AND LANGUAGES:
● Machine Learning and deep learning(python, R)
● Natural Language Processing
● Javascript,HTML&CSS
